## [GitHub README for Rice Classification Notebook](./rice_classification.ipynb)

**Rice Classification**

This notebook explores the classification of rice species based on physical characteristics. The data pertains to two rice species: Cammeo and Osmancik. 


### Data Acquisition

The dataset, ["Rice (Cammeo and Osmancik)"](./Rice_Cammeo_Osmancik.arff), was retrieved from [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/545/rice+cammeo+and+osmancik](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/545/rice+cammeo+and+osmancik).

**Objective**

The objective is to predict the species of a rice sample (Cammeo or Osmancik) based on features like area, perimeter, and eccentricity.

**Data**

The data is loaded from an ARFF file using `arff.loadarff`. It contains features describing the rice grains and a target variable indicating the rice species.

The notebook uses the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

**Methodology**

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
    - Load data from an ARFF file.
    - Convert categorical target variable to string format.
    - Save the data to a CSV file for convenience.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
    - Visualize the distribution of features using pair plots to identify potential relationships between features and the target variable.
    - Analyze descriptive statistics of the features.
3. **Classification**
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    - Train two machine learning models:
        - Naive Bayes classifier (GaussianNB) - assumes features are independent.
        - Decision Tree classifier - considers interactions between features.
    - Evaluate the performance of each model using classification report and accuracy score.
4. **Results**
    - The Naive Bayes classifier achieved a slightly higher accuracy (92%) compared to the Decision Tree classifier (90%).
    - A decision tree visualization is included, but its complexity makes interpretation challenging.

**Results**

Surprisingly, the simpler Naive Bayes model outperformed the Decision Tree in this case. This highlights that complex models don't always guarantee higher accuracy.

The 92% accuracy might be sufficient for some applications, but its real-world usefulness depends on the specific context.

While this model shows promise for rice species classification, relying solely on this approach for critical applications might be risky.

**Future Work**

- Incorporate additional features that might be relevant for classification.
- Improve the interpretability of the decision tree model using feature importance analysis.
- Validate the model performance on a separate dataset.

# [Possum Predictions using Regression Models](./possum_regression.ipynb)

### Data Acquisition

The dataset, ["Possum Regression"](./possum.csv), was retrieved from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abrambeyer/openintro-possum](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abrambeyer/openintro-possum).

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exploring various regression models for predicting the age of possums based on their foot length. The notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of different regression techniques and their performance in predicting possum age.

## Overview

- **Data**: The notebook uses a dataset containing measurements of possums, including foot length and age.
- **Models**: Several regression models are explored, including:
  - Multivariate Linear Regression
  - Univariate Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- **Evaluation**: Each model is evaluated based on its performance metrics, such as mean squared error and R-squared score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the decision tree regressor and SVR models.
- **Comparison**: The performance of each model is compared, considering factors such as accuracy, computational complexity, and interpretability.

## Contents

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing the possum dataset.
2. **Multivariate Linear Regression**: Fitting a multivariate linear regression model and evaluating its performance.
3. **Univariate Linear Regression**: Trying univariate linear regression with foot length as the only feature.
4. **Decision Tree Regressor**: Exploring decision tree regression and hyperparameter tuning using grid search.
5. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Implementing SVR with linear and RBF kernels, and optimizing hyperparameters.
6. **Model Comparison**: Comparing the performance of different regression models and discussing the findings.

## Results

The notebook concludes with insights on the best-performing regression model for predicting possum age based on foot length, considering both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building and evaluating regression models for prediction. It highlights the importance of selecting appropriate models and optimizing hyperparameters for better predictive performance.
